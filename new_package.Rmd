## Introduction

Here are a few notes on starting an R package. For context, I've previously made a [skeleton package](https://github.com/bheavner/packageTest). That may be worth looking at, at least because there's some useful links in the README, but in this case, I'll be doing things a tiny bit differently by starting with an existing R script. 

The current goal is to make a set of R functions to obtain gene definitions from an outside data source and make a table of those gene definitions in the GAC database. We'll bundle those functions up as an R package so it's easy to get them and reuse them, and I'll put the code on github because that's an easy way to distribute it and allow installation from any Internet-connected workstation. 

Coming up with a name is always a hard part - I want something that is general enough, but specific enough.. It's hopeless. So, rather than getting too hung up on it, I'll remember that it can always be changed later. For now, I'll call the project, repository, and R package geneTable.

Basically, this is a second iteration on the skeleton package idea.

## Initializing an R Package

I generally put all the code I'm working on in a directory called `projects` under my home directory. I'll do the same with `geneTable`. I'm currently working to do more and more things in the Hadley Wickham way, so I'll be using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools), augmented with [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) to manage dependancies for increased reproducibility.

Thus, to start the package, I change to my projects directory, start R, and run some commands:
```
cd ~/projects
R
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
install.packages(c("devtools", "packrat"))
devtools::create("geneTable")
packrat::init("geneTable")
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat")) # update all as prompted
devtools::test() # add testing infrastructure
packrat::set_opts(vcs.ignore.src = TRUE) # don't put src in git
q()
```

That process makes some directories. Now ~/projects/geneTable exists, and looks like this (omitting subdirectories under `./packtrat/`:
```
geneTable/
├── DESCRIPTION
├── NAMESPACE
├── R
├── geneTable.Rproj
├── packrat
│   ├── init.R
│   ├── lib
│   ├── lib-R
│   ├── lib-ext
│   ├── packrat.lock
│   ├── packrat.opts
│   └── src
└── tests
    ├── testthat
    └── testthat.R
```

I want this to be under version control, so I'll initialize a git repository:

```
cd ~/projects/geneTable
git init
```

`devtools::create()` made a .gitignore file, but it's pretty limited. Instead, I'll copy one from elsewhere (I really need to make my own!):

```
r -e 'download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/R.gitignore", ".gitignore", "curl")'
```

I also include some edits, adding:
```
# don't commit files that may have passwords
.env
*.cnf

# packrat stuff
packrat-scenario*/
packrat/lib*/
packrat/src/
```

Now, I can add my files to the repository and do my first commit:

```
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
```

Next, I want to have this repository on gitHub, so I need to set up a repository there to use as the origin for this repository.

## Creating a new github repository

So, I'll start by making a github repo for the R package under the [GAC organization github account](https://github.com/UW-GAC/).

A couple notes on the new repository:

* Include a description
* I choose to make it public (the GAC doesn't have private repositories at the moment)
* I'll initialize without a README, license, or .gitignore (making those will be part of the R package)

So now the [geneTable](https://github.com/UW-GAC/geneTable) repository exists!

## pushing local working copy of the code to the repository

To push my repository to gitHub, I need to set github as the origin, and do a push:

```
cd ~/projects/geneTable
git remote add origin https://github.com/UW-GAC/geneTable.git
git push -u origin master
```
